# RQ1 and RQ2 Content

The `data` folder contains the grouping of semantic and syntactic duplicates. Duplicates are stored by model and by classification of submission. Each folder for each model includes the duplicates separated out per exercise as well as an "overview" file that aggregates the information. 

The "UniqueToDupsByType" files stores aggregate information about the rate at which different types of logic have repeated submissions. 

The "UniqueToDupsAnalysis" file store aggregate information about the rate at which each exercise per model has repeated submissions.  

The "UniquesToDups_Type_Overview" file contains the information used to form Figure 2 and Table 2 in the paper.
