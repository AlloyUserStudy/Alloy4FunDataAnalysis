The "AST" files include a breakdown of the AST information about submissions that match the file subheadings. This AST information includes the number of nodes as well as the number of nodes of various types of logic that are present. This later point allows us to know how many operators of different types of logic are present in the formula. This information is used in Table 6.

The "CorrectOracleMatches" file is used for Tables 4 and 5. This file includes the ranking of submissions from most to least submitted for an exercise. This enables us to find the location of the oracle in this ranked list. In addition, the file insides a spreadsheet that analyzes the top submitted correct submission for each exercise so that we can investigate how the formula differs from the oracle, if it does.
