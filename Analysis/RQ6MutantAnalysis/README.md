# RQ6 Content

The `data` folder contains the information about whether or not any of the mutants fix faulty submissions. This information is organized both by type of logic and type of fault. If a submission has multiple fixes, all correcting mutants are listed on the same line.

The "MutantionAnalysisResults" file organizes this information to form Tables 8 and 9 in the paper. This file contains additional perspectives, such as the overview of just the broad type of mutant and their fix rates (replacement, insertion, deletion, exchange).
