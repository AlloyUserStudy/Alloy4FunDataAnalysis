# RQ3 Content

Thw `data` folder considers all subpaths where users make 5 or more invalid attempts in a row.

The `length_of_attmpts` folder contains the content for the average length of attempts at large. This content is not currently in the paper but was collected. 

The `paths_overview` folder contains the content for Table 3 and includes several details about attempts, including how many end up correct, how many attempts are never correct, and how many have invalid attempts.
